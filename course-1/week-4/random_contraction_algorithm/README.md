# Karger's Random Contraction Algorithm

# Overview

This folder contains a script that implements the Random Contraction algorithm.

### Execution steps

To run and test it out for yourself, you must have Python 3 installed on your
system.
Once installed, follow these steps:

```bash
$ python random_contraction_algorithm.py kargerMinCut.txt
Minimum cut count: 17
TIME TAKEN to find the minimum cut: 19.78s
```

**Note:** You can provide any file you want for loading the graph, as long as
it contains lines where each line contains the first entry as the vertex and
the subsequent entries as the other vertices that the said vertex is connected
to.

**Disclaimer:** The time taken to find the minimum cut for the given 200
vertices that has been shown above may vary depending on your machine.
