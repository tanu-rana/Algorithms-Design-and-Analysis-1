# Counting Inversions

## Overview

This directory contains a program for counting the number of inversions in an
array i.e. how far the array is from being sorted.

### Execution steps

To run and test it out for yourself, execute the following steps:

```bash
$ make
$ cat inversions.txt | ./counting_inversions 100000
Number of inversions = 2407905288
TIME IN sorting the array and counting inversions: 0.076969
```

**Note:** The number of inversions for a particular stream of input numbers
will always be the same.

**Disclaimer:** The time to find the number of inversions for 100000 numbers
that has been shown above, may vary depending on your machine configuration.
