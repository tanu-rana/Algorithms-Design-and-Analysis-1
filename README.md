# Algorithms Specialization (Stanford University)

This repository contains my assignments and exercises which I completed while undertaking the courses from the Algorithms specialization on courses.

## Structure

This specialization comprises of 4 courses, namely:

- [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)
- [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)
- [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)
- [Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete)

Each course contains content worth 4 weeks each.

The content of each course is mentioned in their respective README files.
