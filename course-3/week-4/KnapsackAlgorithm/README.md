# Knapsack Problem

## Overview

This folder contains a program that solves the Knapsack problem in which a no.
of items are provided, each with its own value and weight. The size of the
knapsack is also provided. For the problem definition, items are to be chosen
in such a way that the sum of their values needs to be maximized while making
sure that their collective weights do not go beyond the size of the knapsack.

### Execution Steps

To run and test it out for yourself, follow these steps:

```bash
$ javac KnapsackAlgorithm.java
$ java KnapsackAlgorithm knapsack1.txt
Number of items in the knapsack:      40
Sum of values in the knapsack:   2493893
```

**Note:** The file `knapsack1.txt` has been provided here, and is used for the
program to run.
